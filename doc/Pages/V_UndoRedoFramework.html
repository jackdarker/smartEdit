    <h2>Undo & Redo capability</h2>
    <p>Editors should support Undo/Redo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>editing text</li>
        <li>adding/removing/moving files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <p>Every operation is wrapped into a command. The command is pushed to a command stack.</p>
    
    <h2>Commandstack</h2>
    <p>The stack keeps track of a command's undo/redo state. A command is executed when pushed to a stack.</p>
    <p>The command stack is connected by events to UI for update ("canUndo") and triggers ("Undo").</p>
    <p>When a view gets activated, its commandstack will be set to be the active one. There is one command stack per Editor&Document.</p>
